= Time =

Time panel shows the time since MinimOSD-Extra booted up. 

Normally this is also your system boot time also (when only one onboard battery is used or all electronics are turned on together.), but you can reset MinimOSD-Extra by pressing reset button on it. Than this panel will start counting again from zero.
