= OSD Menu =

This is a simple setup menu built in to MinimOSD-Extra firmware.

== Entering the menu ==

You can enter this menu within a minute after MinimOSD has started (use time panel to see), by switching screens.

So if you just booted your system and the timer shows less than 60 sec than by switching to the next screen you enter to configuration menu instead.

After one minute if not in menu switching will work normal.

If you passed one minute but still need to set something, press reset on MinimOSD so you can enter menu again.

You can exit menu by switching screen.


=== Configuring ===

When in menu, you can set values using CH1. Normally your right stick on your transmitter, (left-right).

Step to next or previous menu item using CH1. Normally your right stick on your transmitter, (up-down).
