= Video Standards =

The original firmware had an automatic mechanism that detected standards automatically. That is generally working well, but some situations it failed. So we made it configurable from CT.

Now if you set PAL than MinimOSD-Extra will boot up as PAL and will not try to detect standards anymore.
Or if you set NTSC than MinimOSD-Extra will boot up as an NTSC device and will not try to detect standards enymore.
