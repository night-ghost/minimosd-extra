= WP Direction =

Waypoint direction panel indicates the direction to the next waypoint, relative to your plane. 

You need a magnetometer to make this panel work more precisely. 

It still works well with only GPS, but when there is strong wind, than it can show a bit different waypoint direction (usually it is a good approximation).
